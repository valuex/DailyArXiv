| **[COMEX Copper Futures Volatility Forecasting: Econometric Models and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08356v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the forecasting performance of COMEX copper futures realized volatility across various high-frequency intervals using both econometric volatility models and deep learning recurrent neural network models. The econometric models considered are GARCH and HAR, while the deep learning models include RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). In forecasting daily realized volatility for COMEX copper futures with a rolling window approach, the econometric models, particularly HAR, outperform recurrent neural networks overall, with HAR achieving the lowest QLIKE loss function value. However, when the data is replaced with hourly high-frequency realized volatility, the deep learning models outperform the GARCH model, and HAR attains a comparable QLIKE loss function value. Despite the black-box nature of machine learning models, the deep learning models demonstrate superior forecasting performance, surpassing the fixed QLIKE value of HAR in the experiment. Moreover, as the forecast horizon extends for daily realized volatility, deep learning models gradually close the performance gap with the GARCH model in certain loss function metrics. Nonetheless, HAR remains the most effective model overall for daily realized volatility forecasting in copper futures.</p></details> |  |

Spectral data, obtained through Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA), is utilized for classification. The study compares data from two detectors, cerium bromide (CeBr$_{3}$) and high purity germanium (HPGe), considering their energy resolution and sensitivity. We test various data generation, preprocessing, and classification methods, with Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) yielding the best results. The study also highlights the impact of different detector types on classification accuracy, with CeBr$_{3}$ excelling in short measurement times and HPGe performing better in longer durations. The findings suggest the importance of selecting the appropriate detector and methodology based on specific application requirements.</p></details> |  |

| **[STAMP-2.5D: Structural and Thermal Aware Methodology for Placement in 2.5D Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21140v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiplet-based architectures and advanced packaging has emerged as transformative approaches in semiconductor design. While conventional physical design for 2.5D heterogeneous systems typically prioritizes wirelength reduction through tight chiplet packing, this strategy creates thermal bottlenecks and intensifies coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches, compromising long-term reliability. Addressing these challenges requires holistic consideration of thermal performance, mechanical stress, and interconnect efficiency. We introduce STAMP-2.5D, the first automated floorplanning methodology that simultaneously optimizes these critical factors. Our approach employs finite element analysis to simulate temperature distributions and stress profiles across chiplet configurations while minimizing interconnect wirelength. Experimental results demonstrate that our thermal structural aware automated floorplanning approach reduces overall stress by 11% while maintaining excellent thermal performance with a negligible 0.5% temperature increase and simultaneously reducing total wirelength by 11% compared to temperature-only optimization. Additionally, we conduct an exploratory study on the effects of temperature gradients on structural integrity, providing crucial insights for reliability-conscious chiplet design. STAMP-2.5D establishes a robust platform for navigating critical trade-offs in advanced semiconductor packaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Page, 10 Figures, To be presented at ICCD 2025</p></details> |
| **[3D Magnetic Inverse Routine for Single-Segment Magnetic Field Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11293v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR), which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the 3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning (DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages: i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$ is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>copyr...</summary><p>copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Machine Learning Optimal Ordering in Global Routing Problems in Semiconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21035v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a new method for ordering nets during the process of layer assignment in global routing problems. The global routing problems that we focus on in this work are based on routing problems that occur in the design of substrates in multilayered semiconductor packages. The proposed new method is based on machine learning techniques and we show that the proposed method supersedes conventional net ordering techniques based on heuristic score functions. We perform global routing experiments in multilayered semiconductor package environments in order to illustrate that the routing order based on our new proposed technique outperforms previous methods based on heuristics. Our approach of using machine learning for global routing targets specifically the net ordering step which we show in this work can be significantly improved by deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables; published in Scientific Reports</p></details> |
| **[Machine learning based surrogate models for microchannel heat sink optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09683v2)** | 2022-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microchannel heat sinks are an efficient cooling method for semiconductor packages. However, to properly cool increasingly complex and thermally dense circuits, microchannel designs should be improved and expanded on. In this paper, microchannel designs with secondary channels and with ribs are investigated using computational fluid dynamics and are coupled with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to determine and propose optimal solutions based on observed thermal resistance and pumping power. A workflow that combines Latin hypercube sampling, machine learning-based surrogate modeling and multi-objective optimization is proposed. Random forests, gradient boosting algorithms and neural networks were considered during the search for the best surrogate. We demonstrated that tuned neural networks can make accurate predictions and be used to create an acceptable surrogate model. Optimized solutions show a negligible difference in overall performance when compared to the conventional optimization approach. Additionally, solutions are calculated in one-fifth of the original time. Generated designs attain temperatures that are lower by more than 10% under the same pressure limits as a convectional microchannel design. When limited by temperature, pressure drops are reduced by more than 25%. Finally, the influence of each design variable on the thermal resistance and pumping power was investigated by employing the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique. Overall, we have demonstrated that the proposed framework has merit and can be used as a viable methodology in microchannel heat sink design optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, brief appendix</p></details> |
| **[Topology for Substrate Routing in Semiconductor Package Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07892v1)** | 2021-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a new signal routing method for solving routing problems that occur in the design process of semiconductor package substrates. Our work uses a topological transformation of the layers of the package substrate in order to simplify the routing problem into a problem of connecting points on a circle with non-intersecting straight line segments. The circle, which we call the Circular Frame, is a polygonal schema, which is originally used in topology to study the topological structure of 2-manifolds. We show through experiments that our new routing method based on the Circular Frame competes with certain grid-based routing algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 22 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

| **[Point Cloud Segmentation of Integrated Circuits Package Substrates Surface Defects Using Causal Inference: Dataset Construction and Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05853v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effective segmentation of 3D data is crucial for a wide range of industrial applications, especially for detecting subtle defects in the field of integrated circuits (IC). Ceramic package substrates (CPS), as an important electronic material, are essential in IC packaging owing to their superior physical and chemical properties. However, the complex structure and minor defects of CPS, along with the absence of a publically available dataset, significantly hinder the development of CPS surface defect detection. In this study, we construct a high-quality point cloud dataset for 3D segmentation of surface defects in CPS, i.e., CPS3D-Seg, which has the best point resolution and precision compared to existing 3D industrial datasets. CPS3D-Seg consists of 1300 point cloud samples under 20 product categories, and each sample provides accurate point-level annotations. Meanwhile, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark based on SOTA point cloud segmentation algorithms to validate the effectiveness of CPS3D-Seg. Additionally, we propose a novel 3D segmentation method based on causal inference (CINet), which quantifies potential confounders in point clouds through Structural Refine (SR) and Quality Assessment (QA) Modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CINet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in both mIoU and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analysis of Various Design Pathways Towards Multi-Terabit Photonic On-Interposer Interconnects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07241v1)** | 2023-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the wake of dwindling Moore's Law, to address the rapidly increasing complexity and cost of fabricating large-scale, monolithic systems-on-chip (SoCs), the industry has adopted dis-aggregation as a solution, wherein a large monolithic SoC is partitioned into multiple smaller chiplets that are then assembled into a large system-in-package (SiP) using advanced packaging substrates such as silicon interposer. For such interposer-based SiPs, there is a push to realize on-interposer inter-chiplet communication bandwidth of multi-Tb/s and end-to-end communication latency of no more than 10ns. This push comes as the natural progression from some recent prior works on SiP design, and is driven by the proliferating bandwidth demand of modern data-intensive workloads. To meet this bandwidth and latency goal, prior works have focused on a potential solution of using the silicon photonic interposer (SiPhI) for integrating and interconnecting a large number of chiplets into an SiP. Despite the early promise, the existing designs of on-SiPhI interconnects still have to evolve by leaps and bounds to meet the goal of multi-Tb/s bandwidth. However, the possible design pathways, upon which such an evolution can be achieved, have not been explored in any prior works yet. In this paper, we have identified several design pathways that can help evolve on-SiPhI interconnects to achieve multi-Tb/s aggregate bandwidth. We perform an extensive link-level and system-level analysis in which we explore these design pathways in isolation and in different combinations of each other. From our link-level analysis, we have observed that the design pathways that simultaneously enhance the spectral range and optical power budget available for wavelength multiplexing can render aggregate bandwidth of up to 4Tb/s per on-SiPhI link.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review (ACM JETC)</p></details> |

The idea is inverse operation of a quantum-mechanically reversible multiplier implemented with QA-based Boolean logic circuits. We designed the QA machine on an application-specific-annealing-computing architecture which efficiently increases available hardware budgets at the cost of restricted functionality. The circuits are to be implemented and fabricated by using superconducting integrated circuit technology. We propose a three-dimensional packaging scheme of a qubit-chip / interposer / package-substrate structure for realizing practically-large scale QA systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 6 figures, to appear in IEEE Xplore Conference Proceedings of the 16th International Superconductive Electronics Conference (ISEC 2017)</p></details> |
