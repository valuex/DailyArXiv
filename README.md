| **[COMEX Copper Futures Volatility Forecasting: Econometric Models and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08356v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the forecasting performance of COMEX copper futures realized volatility across various high-frequency intervals using both econometric volatility models and deep learning recurrent neural network models. The econometric models considered are GARCH and HAR, while the deep learning models include RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). In forecasting daily realized volatility for COMEX copper futures with a rolling window approach, the econometric models, particularly HAR, outperform recurrent neural networks overall, with HAR achieving the lowest QLIKE loss function value. However, when the data is replaced with hourly high-frequency realized volatility, the deep learning models outperform the GARCH model, and HAR attains a comparable QLIKE loss function value. Despite the black-box nature of machine learning models, the deep learning models demonstrate superior forecasting performance, surpassing the fixed QLIKE value of HAR in the experiment. Moreover, as the forecast horizon extends for daily realized volatility, deep learning models gradually close the performance gap with the GARCH model in certain loss function metrics. Nonetheless, HAR remains the most effective model overall for daily realized volatility forecasting in copper futures.</p></details> |  |

Spectral data, obtained through Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA), is utilized for classification. The study compares data from two detectors, cerium bromide (CeBr$_{3}$) and high purity germanium (HPGe), considering their energy resolution and sensitivity. We test various data generation, preprocessing, and classification methods, with Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) yielding the best results. The study also highlights the impact of different detector types on classification accuracy, with CeBr$_{3}$ excelling in short measurement times and HPGe performing better in longer durations. The findings suggest the importance of selecting the appropriate detector and methodology based on specific application requirements.</p></details> |  |

| **[Simulation-Driven Evaluation of Chiplet-Based Architectures Using VisualSim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01244v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on the simulation of multi-die System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures using VisualSim, emphasizing chiplet-based system modeling and performance analysis. Chiplet technology presents a promising alternative to traditional monolithic chips, which face increasing challenges in manufacturing costs, power efficiency, and performance scaling. By integrating multiple small modular silicon units into a single package, chiplet-based architectures offer greater flexibility and scalability at a lower overall cost. In this study, we developed a detailed simulation model of a chiplet-based system, incorporating multicore ARM processor clusters interconnected through a ARM CMN600 network-on-chip (NoC) for efficient communication [4], [7]. The simulation framework in VisualSim enables the evaluation of critical system metrics, including inter-chiplet communication latency, memory access efficiency, workload distribution, and the power-performance tradeoff under various workloads. Through simulation-driven insights, this research highlights key factors influencing chiplet system performance and provides a foundation for optimizing future chiplet-based semiconductor designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realization of Graphene Quantum Dots for Innovative Biosensor Development and Diverse Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20547v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates quantum dots (QDs), which are miniature semiconductor structures with remarkable optical and electrical properties due to quantum confinement processes. Traditional QDs, such as CdTe, have been extensively investigated; however, they frequently exhibit toxicity and stability issues. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are emerging as a safer and more stable alternative to traditional QDs. GQDs are honeycomb-lattice carbon atoms with unique electronic and optical properties that make them promising candidates for biomedical, electronic, and energy storage applications. GQD synthesis methods (top-down and bottom-up) and their advantages over standard QDs include better photostability, biocompatibility, and configurable band gaps. GQDs are perfect for real-world uses like sensitive biosensing, real-time food safety monitoring, and smart packaging because of their low toxicity, high sensitivity, and affordability. These uses are all essential for cutting down on food grain waste. This emphasizes the growing significance of GQDs in advancing nanotechnology and their potential integration with quantum technologies, paving the door for creative solutions in biosensing, food safety, environmental monitoring, and future quantum electronics.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAMP-2.5D: Structural and Thermal Aware Methodology for Placement in 2.5D Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21140v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chiplet-based architectures and advanced packaging has emerged as transformative approaches in semiconductor design. While conventional physical design for 2.5D heterogeneous systems typically prioritizes wirelength reduction through tight chiplet packing, this strategy creates thermal bottlenecks and intensifies coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatches, compromising long-term reliability. Addressing these challenges requires holistic consideration of thermal performance, mechanical stress, and interconnect efficiency. We introduce STAMP-2.5D, the first automated floorplanning methodology that simultaneously optimizes these critical factors. Our approach employs finite element analysis to simulate temperature distributions and stress profiles across chiplet configurations while minimizing interconnect wirelength. Experimental results demonstrate that our thermal structural aware automated floorplanning approach reduces overall stress by 11% while maintaining excellent thermal performance with a negligible 0.5% temperature increase and simultaneously reducing total wirelength by 11% compared to temperature-only optimization. Additionally, we conduct an exploratory study on the effects of temperature gradients on structural integrity, providing crucial insights for reliability-conscious chiplet design. STAMP-2.5D establishes a robust platform for navigating critical trade-offs in advanced semiconductor packaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Page, 10 Figures, To be presented at ICCD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Frontier MoE Training with 3D Integrated Optics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15893v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unabated growth in AI workload demands is driving the need for concerted advances in compute, memory, and interconnect performance. As traditional semiconductor scaling slows, high-speed interconnects have emerged as the new scaling engine, enabling the creation of larger logical GPUs by linking many GPUs into a single, low-latency, high-bandwidth compute domain. While initial scale-up fabrics leveraged copper interconnects for their power and cost advantages, the maximum reach of passive electrical interconnects (approximately 1 meter) effectively limits the scale-up domain to within a single rack. The advent of 3D-stacked optics and logic offers a transformative, power-efficient scale-up solution for connecting hundreds of GPU packages (thousands of GPUs) across multiple data center racks. This work explores the design tradeoffs of scale-up technologies and demonstrates how frontier LLMs necessitate novel photonic solutions to achieve aggressive power and performance targets. We model the benefits of 3D CPO (Passage) enabled GPUs and switches within the scale-up domain when training Frontier Mixture of Experts (MoE) models exceeding one trillion parameters. Our results show that the substantial increases in bandwidth and radix enabled by 3D CPO allow for an 8X increase in scale-up capability. This affords new opportunities for multi-dimensional parallelism within the scale-up domain and results in a 2.7X reduction in time-to-train, unlocking unprecedented model scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures.

| **[A Spatial-Physics Informed Model for 3D Spiral Sample Scanned by SQUID Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11853v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy. The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii) magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%. Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>copyr...</summary><p>copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[3D Magnetic Inverse Routine for Single-Segment Magnetic Field Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11293v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial for non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper presents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR), which leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the 3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning (DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based constraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages: i) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\ell/z_o$), where $\ell$ is the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic sensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging spatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for the position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\ell$), current ($I$), and current flow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer then adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\ell$, $I$) to minimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The results demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information with high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction in semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining DL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>copyr...</summary><p>copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[SAFE-SiP: Secure Authentication Framework for System-in-Package Using Multi-party Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09002v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of chiplet-based heterogeneous integration is transforming the semiconductor, AI, and high-performance computing industries by enabling modular designs and improved scalability. However, assembling chiplets from multiple vendors after fabrication introduces a complex supply chain that raises serious security concerns, including counterfeiting, overproduction, and unauthorized access. Current solutions often depend on dedicated security chiplets or changes to the timing flow, which assume a trusted SiP integrator. This assumption can expose chiplet signatures to other vendors and create new attack surfaces. This work addresses those vulnerabilities using Multi-party Computation (MPC), which enables zero-trust authentication without disclosing sensitive information to any party. We present SAFE-SiP, a scalable authentication framework that garbles chiplet signatures and uses MPC for verifying integrity, effectively blocking unauthorized access and adversarial inference. SAFE-SiP removes the need for a dedicated security chiplet and ensures secure authentication, even in untrusted integration scenarios. We evaluated SAFE-SiP on five RISC-V-based System-in-Package (SiP) designs. Experimental results show that SAFE-SiP incurs minimal power overhead, an average area overhead of only 3.05%, and maintains a computational complexity of 2^192, offering a highly efficient and scalable security solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for GLSVLSI 2025, New Orleans, LA, USA</p></details> |
| **[Optimization and Benchmarking of Monolithically Stackable Gain Cell Memory for Last-Level Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06304v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Last Level Cache (LLC) is the processor's critical bridge between on-chip and off-chip memory levels - optimized for high density, high bandwidth, and low operation energy. To date, high-density (HD) SRAM has been the conventional device of choice; however, with the slowing of transistor scaling, as reflected in the industry's almost identical HD SRAM cell size from 5 nm to 3 nm, alternative solutions such as 3D stacking with advanced packaging like hybrid bonding are pursued (as demonstrated in AMD's V-cache). Escalating data demands necessitate ultra-large on-chip caches to decrease costly off-chip memory movement, pushing the exploration of device technology toward monolithic 3D (M3D) integration where transistors can be stacked in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) at the interconnect level. M3D integration requires fabrication techniques compatible with a low thermal budget (<400 degC). Among promising BEOL device candidates are amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) transistors, particularly desirable for their ultra-low leakage (<fA/um), enabling persistent data retention (>seconds) when used in a gain-cell configuration. This paper examines device, circuit, and system-level tradeoffs when optimizing BEOL-compatible AOS-based 2-transistor gain cell (2T-GC) for LLC. A cache early-exploration tool, NS-Cache, is developed to model caches in advanced 7 and 3 nm nodes and is integrated with the Gem5 simulator to systematically benchmark the impact of the newfound density/performance when compared to HD-SRAM, MRAM, and 1T1C eDRAM alternatives for LLC.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Teardown Analysis of Samsung S20 Exynos 990 SoC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16166v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mobile phone has evolved from a simple communication device to a complex and highly integrated system with heterogeneous devices, thanks to the rapid technological developments in the semiconductor industry. Understanding the new technology is indeed a time-consuming and challenging task. Therefore, this study performs a teardown analysis of the Samsung Exynos S20 990 System-on-Chip (SoC), a flagship mobile processor that features a three-dimensional (3D) package on-package (PoP) solution with flip chip interconnect (fcPoP). The fcPoP design integrates the SoC and the memory devices in a single package, reducing the interconnection length and improving signal integrity and power efficiency. The study reveals the complex integration of various components and the advanced features of the SoC. The study also examines the microstructure of the chip and the package using X-ray, SEM, and optical microscopy techniques. Moreover, it demonstrates how the fcPoP design enables the SoC to meet the demands of higher performance, higher bandwidth, lower power consumption, and smaller form factor, especially in 5G mobile applications. The study contributes to understanding advanced packaging methodologies and indicates potential directions for future semiconductor innovations.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The global routing problems that we focus on in this work are based on routing problems that occur in the design of substrates in multilayered semiconductor packages. The proposed new method is based on machine learning techniques and we show that the proposed method supersedes conventional net ordering techniques based on heuristic score functions. We perform global routing experiments in multilayered semiconductor package environments in order to illustrate that the routing order based on our new proposed technique outperforms previous methods based on heuristics. Our approach of using machine learning for global routing targets specifically the net ordering step which we show in this work can be significantly improved by deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables; published in Scientific Reports</p></details> |
| **[Propelling Innovation to Defeat Data-Leakage Hardware Trojans: From Theory to Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20486v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many design companies have gone fabless and rely on external fabrication facilities to produce chips due to increasing cost of semiconductor manufacturing. However, not all of these facilities can be considered trustworthy; some may inject hardware Trojans and jeopardize the security of the system. One common objective of hardware Trojans is to establish a side channel for data leakage. While extensive literature exists on various defensive measures, almost all of them focus on preventing the establishment of side channels, and can be compromised if attackers gain access to the physical chip and can perform reverse engineering between multiple fabrication runs. In this paper, we advance (from theory to practice) RECORD: Randomized Encoding of COmbinational Logic for Resistance to Data Leakage. RECORD is a novel scheme of temporarily randomized encoding for combinational logic that, with the aid of Quilt Packaging, prevents attackers from interpreting the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Vulnerability of Chiplet-Based Systems to Contactless Probing Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14821v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by a need for ever increasing chip performance and inclusion of innovative features, a growing number of semiconductor companies are opting for all-inclusive System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. Although Moore's Law has been able to keep up with the demand for more complex logic, manufacturing large dies still poses a challenge. Increasingly the solution adopted to minimize the impact of silicon defects on manufacturing yield has been to split a design into multiple smaller dies called chiplets which are then brought together on a silicon interposer. Advanced 2.5D and 3D packaging techniques that enable this kind of integration also promise increased power efficiency and opportunities for heterogeneous integration. However, despite their advantages, chiplets are not without issues. Apart from manufacturing challenges that come with new packaging techniques, disaggregating a design into multiple logically and physically separate dies introduces new threats, including the possibility of tampering with and probing exposed data lines. In this paper we evaluate the exposure of chiplets to probing by applying laser contactless probing techniques to a chiplet-based AMD/Xilinx VU9P FPGA. First, we identify and map interposer wire drivers and show that probing them is easier compared to probing internal nodes. Lastly, we demonstrate that delay-based sensors, which can be used to protect against physical probes, are insufficient to protect against laser probing as the delay change due to laser probing is only 0.792ps even at 100\% laser power.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECO-CHIP: Estimation of Carbon Footprint of Chiplet-based Architectures for Sustainable VLSI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09434v3)** | 2024-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decades of progress in energy-efficient and low-power design have successfully reduced the operational carbon footprint in the semiconductor industry. However, this has led to an increase in embodied emissions, encompassing carbon emissions arising from design, manufacturing, packaging, and other infrastructural activities. While existing research has developed tools to analyze embodied carbon at the computer architecture level for traditional monolithic systems, these tools do not apply to near-mainstream heterogeneous integration (HI) technologies. HI systems offer significant potential for sustainable computing by minimizing carbon emissions through two key strategies: ``reducing" computation by reusing pre-designed chiplet IP blocks and adopting hierarchical approaches to system design. The reuse of chiplets across multiple designs, even spanning multiple generations of integrated circuits (ICs), can substantially reduce embodied carbon emissions throughout the operational lifespan. This paper introduces a carbon analysis tool specifically designed to assess the potential of HI systems in facilitating greener VLSI system design and manufacturing approaches. The tool takes into account scaling, chiplet and packaging yields, design complexity, and even carbon overheads associated with advanced packaging techniques employed in heterogeneous systems. Experimental results demonstrate that HI can achieve a reduction of embodied carbon emissions up to 70\% compared to traditional large monolithic systems. These findings suggest that HI can pave the way for sustainable computing practices, contributing to a more environmentally conscious semiconductor industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA)</p></details> |
| **[US Microelectronics Packaging Ecosystem: Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11651v3)** | 2023-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The semiconductor industry is experiencing a significant shift from traditional methods of shrinking devices and reducing costs. Chip designers actively seek new technological solutions to enhance cost-effectiveness while incorporating more features into the silicon footprint. One promising approach is Heterogeneous Integration (HI), which involves advanced packaging techniques to integrate independently designed and manufactured components using the most suitable process technology. However, adopting HI introduces design and security challenges. To enable HI, research and development of advanced packaging is crucial. The existing research raises the possible security threats in the advanced packaging supply chain, as most of the Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) facilities/vendors are offshore. To deal with the increasing demand for semiconductors and to ensure a secure semiconductor supply chain, there are sizable efforts from the United States (US) government to bring semiconductor fabrication facilities onshore. However, the US-based advanced packaging capabilities must also be ramped up to fully realize the vision of establishing a secure, efficient, resilient semiconductor supply chain. Our effort was motivated to identify the possible bottlenecks and weak links in the advanced packaging supply chain based in the US.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[From Talent Shortage to Workforce Excellence in the CHIPS Act Era: Harnessing Industry 4.0 Paradigms for a Sustainable Future in Domestic Chip Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00215v1)** | 2023-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The CHIPS Act is driving the U.S. towards a self-sustainable future in domestic chip production. Decades of outsourced manufacturing, assembly, testing, and packaging has diminished the workforce ecosystem, imposing major limitations on semiconductor companies racing to build new fabrication sites as part of the CHIPS Act. In response, a systemic alliance between academic institutions, the industry, government, various consortiums, and organizations has emerged to establish a pipeline to educate and onboard the next generation of talent. Establishing a stable and continuous flow of talent requires significant time investments and comes with no guarantees, particularly factoring in the low workplace desirability in current fabrication houses for U.S workforce. This paper will explore the feasibility of two paradigms of Industry 4.0, automation and Augmented Reality(AR)/Virtual Reality(VR), to complement ongoing workforce development efforts and optimize workplace desirability by catalyzing core manufacturing processes and effectively enhancing the education, onboarding, and professional realms-all with promising capabilities amid the ongoing talent shortage and trajectory towards advanced packaging.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Machine learning based surrogate models for microchannel heat sink optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09683v2)** | 2022-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microchannel heat sinks are an efficient cooling method for semiconductor packages. However, to properly cool increasingly complex and thermally dense circuits, microchannel designs should be improved and expanded on. In this paper, microchannel designs with secondary channels and with ribs are investigated using computational fluid dynamics and are coupled with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to determine and propose optimal solutions based on observed thermal resistance and pumping power. A workflow that combines Latin hypercube sampling, machine learning-based surrogate modeling and multi-objective optimization is proposed. Random forests, gradient boosting algorithms and neural networks were considered during the search for the best surrogate. We demonstrated that tuned neural networks can make accurate predictions and be used to create an acceptable surrogate model. Optimized solutions show a negligible difference in overall performance when compared to the conventional optimization approach. Additionally, solutions are calculated in one-fifth of the original time. Generated designs attain temperatures that are lower by more than 10% under the same pressure limits as a convectional microchannel design. When limited by temperature, pressure drops are reduced by more than 25%. Finally, the influence of each design variable on the thermal resistance and pumping power was investigated by employing the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique. Overall, we have demonstrated that the proposed framework has merit and can be used as a viable methodology in microchannel heat sink design optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, brief appendix</p></details> |
| **[Reinventing High Performance Computing: Challenges and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02544v1)** | 2022-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The world of computing is in rapid transition, now dominated by a world of smartphones and cloud services, with profound implications for the future of advanced scientific computing. Simply put, high-performance computing (HPC) is at an important inflection point. For the last 60 years, the world's fastest supercomputers were almost exclusively produced in the United States on behalf of scientific research in the national laboratories. Change is now in the wind. While costs now stretch the limits of U.S. government funding for advanced computing, Japan and China are now leaders in the bespoke HPC systems funded by government mandates. Meanwhile, the global semiconductor shortage and political battles surrounding fabrication facilities affect everyone. However, another, perhaps even deeper, fundamental change has occurred. The major cloud vendors have invested in global networks of massive scale systems that dwarf today's HPC systems. Driven by the computing demands of AI, these cloud systems are increasingly built using custom semiconductors, reducing the financial leverage of traditional computing vendors. These cloud systems are now breaking barriers in game playing and computer vision, reshaping how we think about the nature of scientific computation. Building the next generation of leading edge HPC systems will require rethinking many fundamentals and historical approaches by embracing end-to-end co-design; custom hardware configurations and packaging; large-scale prototyping, as was common thirty years ago; and collaborative partnerships with the dominant computing ecosystem companies, smartphone, and cloud computing vendors.</p></details> | 22 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Machine-learning based methodologies for 3d x-ray measurement, characterization and optimization for buried structures in advanced ic packages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04838v2)** | 2021-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For over 40 years lithographic silicon scaling has driven circuit integration and performance improvement in the semiconductor industry. As silicon scaling slows down, the industry is increasingly dependent on IC package technologies to contribute to further circuit integration and performance improvements. This is a paradigm shift and requires the IC package industry to reduce the size and increase the density of internal interconnects on a scale which has never been done before. Traditional package characterization and process optimization relies on destructive techniques such as physical cross-sections and delayering to extract data from internal package features. These destructive techniques are not practical with today's advanced packages. In this paper we will demonstrate how data acquired non-destructively with a 3D X-ray microscope can be enhanced and optimized using machine learning, and can then be used to measure, characterize and optimize the design and production of buried interconnects in advanced IC packages. Test vehicles replicating 2.5D and HBM construction were designed and fabricated, and digital data was extracted from these test vehicles using 3D X-ray and machine learning techniques. The extracted digital data was used to characterize and optimize the design and production of the interconnects and demonstrates a superior alternative to destructive physical analysis. We report an mAP of 0.96 for 3D object detection, a dice score of 0.92 for 3D segmentation, and an average of 2.1um error for 3D metrology on the test dataset. This paper is the first part of a multi-part report.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, to this end, a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method-based framework is developed to simulate steady-state response of semiconductor devices. The proposed framework solves a system of Poisson equation (in electric potential) and drift-diffusion equations (in charge densities), which are nonlinearly coupled via the drift current and the charge distribution. This system is decoupled and linearized using the Gummel method and the resulting equations are discretized using a local DG scheme. The proposed framework is used to simulate geometrically intricate semiconductor devices with realistic models of mobility and recombination rate. Its accuracy is demonstrated by comparing the results to those obtained by the finite volume and finite element methods implemented in a commercial software package.</p></details> |  |

Ceramic package substrates (CPS), as an important electronic material, are essential in IC packaging owing to their superior physical and chemical properties. However, the complex structure and minor defects of CPS, along with the absence of a publically available dataset, significantly hinder the development of CPS surface defect detection. In this study, we construct a high-quality point cloud dataset for 3D segmentation of surface defects in CPS, i.e., CPS3D-Seg, which has the best point resolution and precision compared to existing 3D industrial datasets. CPS3D-Seg consists of 1300 point cloud samples under 20 product categories, and each sample provides accurate point-level annotations. Meanwhile, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark based on SOTA point cloud segmentation algorithms to validate the effectiveness of CPS3D-Seg. Additionally, we propose a novel 3D segmentation method based on causal inference (CINet), which quantifies potential confounders in point clouds through Structural Refine (SR) and Quality Assessment (QA) Modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CINet significantly outperforms existing algorithms in both mIoU and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI) technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI modules-achieves a record 45\% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance characteristics are experimentally verified.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure User-friendly Blockchain Modular Wallet Design Using Android & OP-TEE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17988v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging crypto economies still hemorrhage digital assets because legacy wallets leak private keys at almost every layer of the software stack, from user-space libraries to kernel memory dumps. This paper solves that twin crisis of security and interoperability by re-imagining key management as a platform-level service anchored in ARM TrustZone through OP-TEE. Our architecture fractures the traditional monolithic Trusted Application into per-chain modules housed in a multi-tenant TA store, finally breaking OP-TEE's single-binary ceiling. A cryptographically sealed firmware-over-the-air pipeline welds each TA set to an Android system image, enabling hot-swap updates while Verified Boot enforces rollback protection. Every package carries a chained signature developer first, registry second so even a compromised supply chain cannot smuggle malicious code past the Secure World's RSA-PSS gatekeeper. Inside the TEE, strict inter-TA isolation, cache partitioning, and GP-compliant crypto APIs ensure secrets never bleed across trust boundaries or timing domains. The Rich Execution Environment can interact only via hardware-mediated Secure Monitor Calls, collapsing the surface exposed to malware in Android space. End-users enjoy a single polished interface yet can install or retire Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or tomorrow's chain with one tap, shrinking both storage footprint and audit scope. For auditors, the composition model slashes duplicated verification effort by quarantining blockchain logic inside narrowly scoped modules that share formally specified interfaces. Our threat analysis spans six adversary layers and shows how the design neutralizes REE malware sniffing, OTA injection, and cross-module side channels without exotic hardware. A reference implementation on AOSP exports a Wallet Manager HAL, custom SELinux domains, and a CI/CD pipeline that vet community modules before release. The result is not merely another hardware wallet but a programmable substrate that can evolve at the velocity of the blockchain ecosystem. By welding radical extensibility to hardware-anchored assurance, the platform closes the security-usability gap that has long stymied mass-market self-custody. We posit that modular TEEs are the missing OS primitive for Web3, much as virtual memory unlocked multi-tasking in classical computing. Together, these contributions sketch a blueprint for multi-chain asset management that is auditable, resilient, and poised for global deployment.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Two packaging options for such systems are the established organic substrates and the emerging glass substrates. These substrates are used to implement the inter-chiplet interconnect (ICI), which is crucial for overall system performance. To guide the development of ICIs, we introduce three design principles for ICI network topologies on organic and glass substrates. Based on our design principles, we propose the novel FoldedHexaTorus network topology. Our evaluation shows that the FoldedHexaTorus achieves significantly higher throughput than state-of-the-art topologies while maintaining low latency.</p></details> |  |

The global routing problems that we focus on in this work are based on routing problems that occur in the design of substrates in multilayered semiconductor packages. The proposed new method is based on machine learning techniques and we show that the proposed method supersedes conventional net ordering techniques based on heuristic score functions. We perform global routing experiments in multilayered semiconductor package environments in order to illustrate that the routing order based on our new proposed technique outperforms previous methods based on heuristics. Our approach of using machine learning for global routing targets specifically the net ordering step which we show in this work can be significantly improved by deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables; published in Scientific Reports</p></details> |
| **[OpenChemIE: An Information Extraction Toolkit For Chemistry Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01462v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information extraction from chemistry literature is vital for constructing up-to-date reaction databases for data-driven chemistry. Complete extraction requires combining information across text, tables, and figures, whereas prior work has mainly investigated extracting reactions from single modalities. In this paper, we present OpenChemIE to address this complex challenge and enable the extraction of reaction data at the document level. OpenChemIE approaches the problem in two steps: extracting relevant information from individual modalities and then integrating the results to obtain a final list of reactions. For the first step, we employ specialized neural models that each address a specific task for chemistry information extraction, such as parsing molecules or reactions from text or figures. We then integrate the information from these modules using chemistry-informed algorithms, allowing for the extraction of fine-grained reaction data from reaction condition and substrate scope investigations. Our machine learning models attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated individually, and we meticulously annotate a challenging dataset of reaction schemes with R-groups to evaluate our pipeline as a whole, achieving an F1 score of 69.5%. Additionally, the reaction extraction results of \ours attain an accuracy score of 64.3% when directly compared against the Reaxys chemical database. We provide OpenChemIE freely to the public as an open-source package, as well as through a web interface.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</p></details> |

Their additive manufacturing on sustainable substrates offers unique advantages for future electronics, including low environmental impact. Here, exploiting structure-property relationship of MoS2 nanoflake-based resistive layer, we present paper-based, inkjet-printed, reconfigurable memristors. With >90% yield from a 16x65 device array, our memristors demonstrate robust resistive switching, with $>10^5$ ON-OFF ratio and <0.5 V operation in non-volatile state. Through modulation of compliance current, the devices transition into volatile state, with only 50 pW switching power consumption, rivalling state-of-the-art metal oxide-based counterparts. We show device recyclability and stable, reconfigurable operation following disassembly, material collection and re-fabrication. We further demonstrate synaptic plasticity and neuronal leaky integrate-and-fire functionality, with disposable applications in smart packaging and simulated medical image diagnostics. Our work shows a sustainable pathway towards printable, high-yield, reconfigurable neuromorphic devices, with minimal environmental footprint.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[An Analysis of Various Design Pathways Towards Multi-Terabit Photonic On-Interposer Interconnects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07241v1)** | 2023-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the wake of dwindling Moore's Law, to address the rapidly increasing complexity and cost of fabricating large-scale, monolithic systems-on-chip (SoCs), the industry has adopted dis-aggregation as a solution, wherein a large monolithic SoC is partitioned into multiple smaller chiplets that are then assembled into a large system-in-package (SiP) using advanced packaging substrates such as silicon interposer. For such interposer-based SiPs, there is a push to realize on-interposer inter-chiplet communication bandwidth of multi-Tb/s and end-to-end communication latency of no more than 10ns. This push comes as the natural progression from some recent prior works on SiP design, and is driven by the proliferating bandwidth demand of modern data-intensive workloads. To meet this bandwidth and latency goal, prior works have focused on a potential solution of using the silicon photonic interposer (SiPhI) for integrating and interconnecting a large number of chiplets into an SiP. Despite the early promise, the existing designs of on-SiPhI interconnects still have to evolve by leaps and bounds to meet the goal of multi-Tb/s bandwidth. However, the possible design pathways, upon which such an evolution can be achieved, have not been explored in any prior works yet. In this paper, we have identified several design pathways that can help evolve on-SiPhI interconnects to achieve multi-Tb/s aggregate bandwidth. We perform an extensive link-level and system-level analysis in which we explore these design pathways in isolation and in different combinations of each other. From our link-level analysis, we have observed that the design pathways that simultaneously enhance the spectral range and optical power budget available for wavelength multiplexing can render aggregate bandwidth of up to 4Tb/s per on-SiPhI link.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review (ACM JETC)</p></details> |
| **[WiForceSticker: Batteryless, Thin Sticker-like Flexible Force Sensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09217v1)** | 2022-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Any two objects in contact with each other exert a force that could be simply due to gravity or mechanical contact, such as a robotic arm gripping an object or even the contact between two bones at our knee joints. The ability to naturally measure and monitor these contact forces allows a plethora of applications from warehouse management (detect faulty packages based on weights) to robotics (making a robotic arms' grip as sensitive as human skin) and healthcare (knee-implants). It is challenging to design a ubiquitous force sensor that can be used naturally for all these applications. First, the sensor should be small enough to fit in narrow spaces. Next, we don't want to lay cumbersome cables to read the force values from the sensors. Finally, we need to have a battery-free design to meet the in-vivo applications. We develop WiForceSticker, a wireless, battery-free, sticker-like force sensor that can be ubiquitously deployed on any surface, such as all warehouse packages, robotic arms, and knee joints. WiForceSticker first designs a tiny $4$~mm~$\times$~$2$~mm~$\times$~$0.4$~mm capacitative sensor design equipped with a $10$~mm~$\times$~$10$~mm antenna designed on a flexible PCB substrate. Secondly, it introduces a new mechanism to transduce the force information on ambient RF radiations that can be read by a remotely located reader wirelessly without requiring any battery or active components at the force sensor, by interfacing the sensors with COTS RFID systems. The sensor can detect forces in the range of $0$-$6$~N with sensing accuracy of $<0.5$~N across multiple testing environments and evaluated with over $10,000$ varying force level presses on the sensor. We also showcase two application case studies with our designed sensors, weighing warehouse packages and sensing forces applied by bone joints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mining logical circuits in fungi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05336v1)** | 2021-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Living substrates are capable for nontrivial mappings of electrical signals due to the substrate nonlinear electrical characteristics. This property can be used to realise Boolean functions. Input logical values are represented by amplitude or frequency of electrical stimuli. Output logical values are decoded from electrical responses of living substrates. We demonstrate how logical circuits can be implemented in mycelium bound composites. The mycelium bound composites (fungal materials) are getting growing recognition as building, packaging, decoration and clothing materials. Presently the fungal materials are passive. To make the fungal materials adaptive, i.e. sensing and computing, we should embed logical circuits into them. We demonstrate experimental laboratory prototypes of many-input Boolean functions implemented in fungal materials from oyster fungi \emph{P. ostreatus}. We characterise complexity of the functions discovered via complexity of the space-time configurations of one-dimensional cellular automata governed by the functions. We show that the mycelium bound composites can implement representative functions from all classes of cellular automata complexity including the computationally universal. The results presented will make an impact in the field of unconventional computing, experimental demonstration of purposeful computing with fungi, and in the field of intelligent materials, as the prototypes of computing mycelium bound composites.</p></details> |  |

Our work uses a topological transformation of the layers of the package substrate in order to simplify the routing problem into a problem of connecting points on a circle with non-intersecting straight line segments. The circle, which we call the Circular Frame, is a polygonal schema, which is originally used in topology to study the topological structure of 2-manifolds. We show through experiments that our new routing method based on the Circular Frame competes with certain grid-based routing algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 22 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Vacuum-formed 3D printed electronics: fabrication of thin, rigid and free-form interactive surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12601v2)** | 2021-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vacuum-forming is a common manufacturing technique for constructing thin plastic shell products by pressing heated plastic sheets onto a mold using atmospheric pressure. Vacuum-forming is ubiquitous in packaging and casing products in industry spanning fast moving consumer goods to connected devices. Integrating advanced functionality, which may include sensing, computation and communication, within thin structures is desirable for various next-generation interactive devices. Hybrid additive manufacturing techniques like thermoforming are becoming popular for prototyping freeform electronics given its design flexibility, speed and cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we present a new hybrid method for constructing thin, rigid and free-form interconnected surfaces via fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing and vacuum-forming. While 3D printing a mold for vacuum-forming has been explored by many, utilising 3D printing to construct sheet materials has remains unexplored. 3D printing the sheet material allows embedding conductive traces within thin layers of the substrate, which can be vacuum-formed but remain conductive and insulated. We characterise the behaviour of the vacuum-formed 3D printed sheet, analyse the electrical performance of 3D printed traces after vacuum-forming, and showcase a range of examples constructed using the technique. We demonstrate a new design interface specifically for designing conformal interconnects, which allows designers to draw conductive patterns in 3D and export pre-distorted sheet models ready to be 3D printed.</p></details> | 9 pages, 14 figures |

In order to analyze the between researcher variability in data analysis choices as well as the aspects within the data analysis pipeline that contribute to the variability in results, we have created two R packages: matahari and tidycode. These packages build on methods created for natural language processing; rather than allowing for the processing of natural language, we focus on R code as the substrate of interest. The matahari package facilitates the logging of everything that is typed in the R console or in an R script in a tidy data frame. The tidycode package contains tools to allow for analyzing R calls in a tidy manner. We demonstrate the utility of these packages as well as walk through two examples.</p></details> |  |

| **[A new shell formulation for graphene structures based on existing ab-initio data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08965v2)** | 2017-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An existing hyperelastic membrane model for graphene calibrated from ab-initio data (Kumar and Parks, 2014) is adapted to curvilinear coordinates and extended to a rotation-free shell formulation based on isogeometric finite elements. Therefore, the membrane model is extended by a hyperelastic bending model that reflects the ab-inito data of Kudin et al. (2001). The proposed formulation can be implemented straight-forwardly into an existing finite element package, since it does not require the description of molecular interactions. It thus circumvents the use of interatomic potentials that tend to be less accurate than ab-initio data. The proposed shell formulation is verified and analyzed by a set of simple test cases. The results are in agreement to analytical solutions and satisfy the FE patch test. The performance of the shell formulation for graphene structures is illustrated by several numerical examples. The considered examples are indentation and peeling of graphene and torsion, bending and axial stretch of carbon nanotubes. Adhesive substrates are modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential and a coarse grained contact model. In principle, the proposed formulation can be extended to other 2D materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>New e...</summary><p>New examples are added and some typos are removed.

Computational simulation is an established methodology for the design and optimization of bioprocesses, where the finite elements method (FEM) is at the state-of-art engineering multi-physics simulation system, with tools such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Although FEA and CFD are currently applied to bioreactor design, most simulations are restricted to the multi-physics capabilities of the existing sofware packages. This manuscript is a contribution for the consolidation of FEM in computational biotechnology, by presenting a comprehensive review of finite element procedures of the most common enzymatic mechanisms found in biotechnological processes, such as, enzyme activation, Michaelis Menten, competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition, anti-competitive inhibition, competition by substrate, sequential random mechanism, ping-pong bi-bi and Theorel-Chance. Most importantly, the manuscript opens the possibility for the use of FEM in conjunction with «in-silico» models of metabolic networks, as well as, chemical networks in order to simulate complex bioprocesses in biotechnology, putting emphasis into flux balance analysis, pheno-metabolomics space exploration in time and space, overcoming the limitations of assuming chemostat conditions in systems biology computations.</p></details> |  |

The objectives of this project are to produce and demonstrate the efficiency of the passive cooling technology (heat pipe) integrated in a very thin electronic substrate that is a part of a multifunctional 3-D electronic package. The enhanced technology is dedicated to the thermal management of high dissipative microsystems having heat densities of more than 10W/cm2. Future applications are envisaged in the avionics sector. In this research 2D numerical hydraulic model has been developed to investigate the performance of a very thin flat micro heat pipe with sintered copper wick structure, using water as a refrigerant. Finite difference method has been used to develop the model. The model has been used to determine the mass transfer and fluid flow in order to evaluate the limits of heat transport capacity as functions of the dimensions of the wick and the vapour space and for various copper spheres radii. The results are presented in terms of liquid and vapour pressures within the heat pipe. The simulated results are validated by experiments and proved that the method can be further used to predict thermal performance of the heat pipe and to optimise its design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted on behalf of EDA Publishing Association (http://irevues.inist.fr/EDA-Publishing)</p></details> |

During bonding, continuous AuIn2, Ni3(Sn,In)4 and Cu6(Sn,In)5 intermetallic compound (IMC) layers were formed at the solder/E-NG, solder/ENIG and solder/OSP interface, respectively. The interfacial reactions between the solder and I-Ag substrate during bonding resulted in the formation of Cu6(Sn,In)5 and Cu(Sn,In)2 IMCs with a minor Ag element. The In-48Sn/I-Ag solder joint showed the best shear properties among the four solder joints after bonding, whereas the solder/ENIG solder joint exhibited the weakest mechanical integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted on behalf of TIMA Editions (http://irevues.inist.fr/tima-editions)</p></details> |
